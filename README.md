# PlotAudio
## Draws audio waveforms

The associated Xcode project implements a SwiftUI app for macOS and iOS that processes audio samples in a file to plot their decibel levels over time. 

Learn more about plotting audio samples from our [in-depth blog post](https://www.limit-point.com/blog/2022/plot-audio).

The subfolder *PlotAudio* contains a small set of independent files that prepare and display audio data in a specialized interactive view. The remaining files build an app around that functionality.  

A list of audio and video files for processing is included in the bundle resources subdirectories *Audio Files* and *Video Files*.

Add your own audio and video files or use the sample set provided. 

Tap on a file in the list to plot its audio.

Adjust controls for appearance and drag or tap on the audio plot to set play locations.
