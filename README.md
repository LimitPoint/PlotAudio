# PlotAudio
## Draws audio waveforms

The associated Xcode project implements a SwiftUI app for macOS and iOS that processes audio samples in a file to plot their decibel levels over time. 

Learn more about plotting audio samples from our [in-depth blog post](https://www.limit-point.com/blog/2022/plot-audio).

The subfolder *PlotAudio* contains a small set of independent files that prepare and display audio data in a specialized interactive view. The remaining files build an app around that functionality.  

A list of audio and video files for processing is included in the bundle resources subdirectories *Audio Files* and *Video Files*.

Add your own audio and video files or use the sample set provided. 

Tap on a file in the list to plot its audio.

Adjust controls for appearance and drag or tap on the audio plot to set play locations.

The core files that implement preparing and plotting audio data in a view: 

* DownsampleAudio : The [AVFoundation], [Accelerate] and [SwiftUI] code that processes audio samples for plotting as a [Path] with the `PlotAudio` Function.
* PlotAudioWaveformView : The [View] that draws the plot of the processed audio samples.
* PlotAudioObservable : The [ObservableObject] that handles interacting with the plot such as dragging to set play location via its `PlotAudioDelegate`, or updating when necessary.

The *PlotAudio* folder can be added to other projects to display audio plots of media [URL] or [AVAsset]. The Xcode preview of `PlotAudioWaveformView` is setup to display the audio plots of three included audio files.
